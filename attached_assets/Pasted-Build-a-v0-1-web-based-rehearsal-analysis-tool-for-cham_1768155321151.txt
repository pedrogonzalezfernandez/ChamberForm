Build a v0.1 web-based rehearsal/analysis tool for chamber-music students.

Core idea
- Users upload a score in MusicXML.
- The backend runs Python + music21 to parse the score and expose analysis workflows.
- The frontend (React + Vite) renders the score in the browser and provides controls to:
  1) select a section (by measure range for v0.1),
  2) choose a music21 “workflow” from a menu,
  3) view the results as overlays / panels,
  4) play back rehearsal-oriented audio (simple reduction / tuning support).

Rendering + audio
- Score rendering must use Verovio in the browser.
  - If Verovio can’t directly render the uploaded MusicXML, convert it server-side to MEI (or another Verovio-compatible format) and send that to the client.
- Audio playback should use Tone.js (WebAudio) unless you find a clearly better integration for the requirements.
  - v0.1 playback focus: a simple harmonic reduction using clean sine tones (for tuning) over the selected measure range, with loop + tempo controls.

Minimum working flow (must be functional)
1) Upload MusicXML.
2) Display the score (Verovio).
3) Show a “section selection” UI: start measure + end measure.
4) Show a “Workflow” dropdown populated from the backend.
5) When the user clicks “Run workflow”, call the backend and show results in an Analysis panel.
6) Provide “Play reduction / Stop / Loop / Tempo” controls for the selected section.

Backend: music21 workflow bridge (important)
- Create a simple registry of workflows (a dictionary/map of workflow_id -> function) so more music21 processes can be added easily.
- Implement at least these workflows in v0.1:
  - Global key estimate
  - Chordified harmony-by-measure (simple chord labels and pitch sets)
  - Reduction data for playback (events per measure with chord tones as frequencies)
- The frontend should not hardcode workflow names; it should request the available workflows from the backend and populate the dropdown.

API (high level)
- Endpoint to upload the file and return:
  - a scoreId
  - the data needed to render in Verovio (MEI or compatible)
  - basic metadata (title, parts, measure count)
- Endpoint to list workflows
- Endpoint to run a workflow on a selected measure range
- Endpoint to return reduction playback events for Tone.js scheduling

Project quality
- Make the app run in Replit.
- Keep it lightweight and clean.
- Add basic error handling for invalid files and failed workflows.
- Provide a README explaining:
  - how to run in Replit
  - how to add a new workflow to the music21 registry
  - how the client requests workflows and displays results

Deliverable
A working prototype where I can upload a chamber-music MusicXML score, see it rendered, select a measure range, choose a workflow from a menu, view results, and play a sine-tone reduction loop for rehearsal/tuning.
